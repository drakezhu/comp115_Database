1) In auto-commit mode (no transaction boundaries), there are bad
balances and bad audits, but nothing else goes wrong. Explain this by
demonstrating the interleaving of the steps of two processes that can
produce a) a bad balance, and b) a bad audit.

2) With READ COMMITTED isolation, there are bad balances, but nothing
else goes wrong. Explain this, again by showing an interleaving of the
steps of two processes.

3) With SERIALIZABLE isolation, the only problem is failed
transfers. (You could conceivably see a failed commit too.) Explain a
failed transfer by showing an interleaving of the steps of two
processes that produces this result.
