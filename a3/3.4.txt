4.1
	The Candidate Key is V
	X -> Y,Z violates BCNF
	The clousure of this dependency is (X,Y,Z)
	The improved BCNF schema is: {X,Y,Z}, {V,W,X}
4.2
	The Candidate Key is (W,X)

	X -> Z violates BCNF
	The clousure of this dependency is (X,Z)
	The improved schema is {W,X,Y}, {X,Z}

	Y -> W also violates BCNF
	The clousure of this dependency is (Y,W)
	The improved schema after the first step would be: {W,Y},{W,X},{X,Y}
