Result:
Original cost for query without creating any index is: 37573.87
After adding index s(s_id), index s(u_id, t_id), index u(u_5) the cost for the query is: 69.33

Analysis:
Firstly the condition that u_5 = 0 is selective since there are only 5 qualified results in 400000 rows. Then we create u_id and t_id in table s thus apply the results that generated from former index as the new index. Thus we can avoid cost by creating these three index.
